## Challenge part 2:
1. Create a separate component called "Pad" and replace the `button` above with our `<Pad />` component
2. Pass the Pad component a prop called `color` with the value of the same name from the `padsData` objects
3. In the Pad component, apply an inline style to the `<button>` to set the backgroundColor of the button.
(We'll deal with the "on" property soon)
