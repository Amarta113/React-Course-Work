# Learn React - My Challenge Solutions

This repo holds my personal solutions to every challenge in
[Scrimba’s Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).
I’m using it as a learning log and a way to revisit concepts later.

## How It’s Organized
- Each folder matches the corresponding course section.
- Inside each folder you’ll find my final code for that challenge, and a README with the challenge details and additional reference links.
